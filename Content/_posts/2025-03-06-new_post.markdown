## Starting a blog

Hi visitor!

After following [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) for some time and reading various super interesting blogposts I have decided to setup a blog site myself.

It took some experimenting on what setup I would choose but I found, as with more things in life, the simpler the better.

I ended up setting up Jekyll with Github pages. Low maintance and easy post addition.
